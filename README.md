Description
===========

authnet_cim is an interface ti Authorize.net's Customer Information Manager. It works, but I don't consider it production ready yet as the interface isn't very well defined and there is no documentation.


Requirements
============

* [node.js](http://nodejs.org/) -- v0.6.0 or newer

Install
============

npm install authnet_cim
